#2.Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included).
# def printValues():
#     l = list()
#     for i in range(1, 31):
#         l.append(i ** 2)
#     print(l)
# printValues()

#3.Assign a different name to function and call it through the new name

# def student(name,age):
#     print(name,age)
# student("Athul",22)
# new_student=student
# new_student("namil",23)

#4.Generate a Python list of all the even numbers between 4 to 30
# def even():
#     l= []
#     for i in range(4,31):
#         if i % 2 == 0:
#             l.append(i)
#     print(l)
# print("Even numbers between 4 to 30")
# even()

#5.Python function that accepts two numbers as arguments and returns the sum
# def sum(a,b):
#     print("sum is :",a+b)
# print("sum of 2 numbers are:")
# sum(2,4)

#7.Python function that returns a tuple
def name():
    return "athul"
print(name())
